  <h1>Exercise 2: Heading Levels</h1>

  <h1>This is a Heading 1 — the biggest and most important heading on a page</h1>
  <h2>This is a Heading 2 — slightly smaller, used for main sections under H1</h2>
  <h3>This is a Heading 3 — smaller again, used for subsections under H2</h3>
  <h4>This is a Heading 4 — used for sub-subsections, rarely needed</h4>
  <h5>This is a Heading 5 — very small, not often used</h5>
 <h6>This is a Heading 6 — the smallest heading level in HTML.  
      There is no <code>&lt;h7&gt;</code> or beyond — if we need different sizes,we can use CSS.</h6>
