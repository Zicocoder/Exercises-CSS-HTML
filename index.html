  <h1>Exercise 2: Heading Levels</h1>

  <h1>This is a Heading 1 — the biggest and most important heading on a page</h1>
  <h2>This is a Heading 2 — slightly smaller, used for main sections under H1</h2>
  <h3>This is a Heading 3 — smaller again, used for subsections under H2</h3>
  <h4>This is a Heading 4 — used for sub-subsections, rarely needed</h4>
  <h5>This is a Heading 5 — very small, not often used</h5>
 <h6>This is a Heading 6 — the smallest heading level in HTML.  
      There is no <code>&lt;h7&gt;</code> or beyond — if we need different sizes,we can use CSS.</h6>

<h2>Exercise 3: Paragraphs and Line Breaks</h2>

<p>
  A paragraph in HTML is created with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element.  
  Every time you use <code>&lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt;</code>, the browser starts a new block of text with extra spacing.
</p>

<p>
  A line break is created with the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag.  
  It is an "empty element" — it has no closing tag.  
  You place <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> at the end of a line when you want the following text to continue on the next line, 
  but still inside the same paragraph.
</p>

<h3>Without line breaks</h3>
<p>
  This is the first line. This is the second line. This is the last line.
</p>

<p>
  Example with line breaks (notice we add <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> after each line except the last one):<br>
  This is the first line.<br>
  This is the second line.<br>
  This is the last line (no <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> needed after this).
